OVERVIEW

pdsinfo and pdsmerge are utilites are for use with Level-0 MODIS data files
in the PDS file format. If you are processing MODIS Level-0 data with
corrupt or missing packets and the SeaDAS l0fix_modis binary (automatically
triggered by SeaDAS when needed) fails to sufficiently repair a file for
successful processing, then it is possible pdsmerge could be used to fix
the file.

pdsmerge also has the capability to merge overlapping PDS passes/granules
from the SAME ORBIT from different receiving stations (including Level-0
granules obtained from the Ocean Biology Processing Group). pdsmerge can
also be used to split up DB passes into granules.

===========================================================================
pdsinfo - provides info about the contents of a PDS file

Usage: pdsinfo <input MODIS Level-0 PDS file>

Usage example: pdsinfo MOD00.P2009111.2235_1.PDS

Build command: cc pdsinfo.c -o pdsinfo -lm

===========================================================================
pdsmerge - removes bad packets from a PDS file
         - removes all packets having a different APID than that specified
           on the command-line
         - merges overlapping PDS files from different sources (overlapping
           refers to successive granules from the SAME ORBIT, not adjacent
           granules from different orbits!)
         - splits DB passes into granules

Usage : pdsmerge start_date end_date APID <input 1> [<input 2> [...]] output
        (where start_date/end_date format is: YYYY/MM/DD,hh:mm:ss or -)

Usage example: pdsmerge - - 64 MOD00.P2009111.2235_1.PDS MOD00.P2009111.2235_1.fixed

Build command: cc pdsmerge.c -o pdsmerge -lm
